üß© User Story

Title:

Contract Lifecycle Management with Role-Based Access and Bilingual Support

As a:

System user (e.g., contract manager, admin, staff)

I want to:

Create, edit, save, print, and finalize rental contracts through a web-based application with multi-language support (English/Arabic) and defined user permissions.

So that I can:

Digitally manage contracts efficiently, maintain audit trails, and ensure accuracy, accountability, and compliance with internal control policies.
